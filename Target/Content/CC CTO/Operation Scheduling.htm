        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Operation scheduling in <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|configure to order</span> allows users to perform rough scheduling and supply planning according to milestones. The document schedule is assigned in the Sales Order line  and in the Purchase Order line.</p>
        <p>Since several milestones may be connected, the schedule provides a temporal sequence and a duration overview without already requiring BOMs or work plans, or even direct relation to events within the ERP system. This schedule can be stored early in the Sales Order and serve as a communication device or guideline for employees.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Scheduling configuration can be opened from the <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|configure to order</span> menu by clicking <span class="Bold">Operation Schedule Setup</span>. In this menu, basic settings are defined.</p>

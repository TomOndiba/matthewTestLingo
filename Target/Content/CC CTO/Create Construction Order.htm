        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When an item is replaced or inserted into the Service BOM using the Service Item Worksheet, it is possible to create a Construction Order for the item if construction is necessary. After inserting or replacing the component (refer to topic <MadCap:xref href="Substitution of Service Item.htm#_Ref351128564">“Substitution of Service Item Components” on page 1</MadCap:xref>), click <span class="Bold">Line &gt; Construction Order</span> on the <span class="Bold">Lines</span> FastTab of the <span class="Bold">Service Item Worksheet</span> page. Click <span class="Bold">Yes</span> to create a Construction Order.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If the component from the Service BOM was replaced, and the component has a BOM, the BOM will be copied within the new Construction Order. After all necessary updates are made to the Construction Order (refer to topic <MadCap:xref href="Construction Order.htm#_Ref406766222">“Construction Order” on page 1</MadCap:xref>), a Production Order can be created.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Changes that were made in the Construction BOM can be written back to the Service BOM by clicking <span class="Bold">Actions &gt; Transfer Back to Service BOM</span> on the <span class="Bold">Construction Order</span> page. All changes will be copied into the Service BOM so a record of the current configuration of the Service Item can be made.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNoteheading">Note</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNotebody">Only replaced components – not new components – can be transferred back to the Service BOM. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">For example, if a new component is added in the <span class="Bold">Service Item Worksheet</span> and a Construction Order is created, the new component cannot be transferred back to the Service BOM because it currently does not exist in the Service BOM. But if the component was replaced in the <span class="Bold">Service Item Worksheet</span> and a Construction Order is created, the replaced component can be transferred back to the Service BOM because the existing Service BOM lines are deleted and replaced with the Construction BOM.</p>

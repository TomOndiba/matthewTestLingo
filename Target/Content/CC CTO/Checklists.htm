        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Checklists in <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|configure to order</span> provide a standardized handling of orders and are assigned to items. During the handling of a sales order or construction order, the checklists serve as the templates of the order specification. Thereby the assumed options and rules are defaulted.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The checklists consist of questions and answers that can be captured in separate templates as master data. Dependence between questions and answers are defined with formulas and rules, so that only plausible answers to a question can be captured.</p>

        <p class="ccBildFigure" MadCap:autonum="Fig. 1">: Checklist Template</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The checklists can be used in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">As system-oriented illustration of manual checklists. Here the checklist contains a questionnaire that the user can process like a conventional checklist to guarantee that all relevant questions for handling of an order are asked.</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">As dynamic checklists without reference to Master BOMs. With this kind of use, logic is integrated into the checklist that supports the user during processing. Through the logic invalid options are faded out automatically or wrongly selected options are acknowledged with an error message. This use serves only for the process security during the handling of an order, without which a compelling configuration is intended.</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">As dynamic checklists with an integrated logic as the basis for an automatic generation of a parts list. In this option, the inputs made in the checklist are used to provide the course of the configuration parts lists automatically when relating to orders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">After Checklist Templates are created, they are assigned to an item. Several checklists can be assigned to an item, which allows for the handling of different requirements, such as selling or construction. Refer to section <MadCap:xref href="Item Card_Navigate Tab.htm">“Navigate Tab ” on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">During the handling of an order, the Checklist Template is copied to the order and the information is entered and selected; the Checklist Template itself is never changed.</p>

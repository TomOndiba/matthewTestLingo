        </div>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The item master can become a master BOM and checklists can be assigned to it. Formulas, functions and variables assigned in the master BOM and checklist work together to form a configuration, which is used to produce a BOM. The checklists are populated in the quote, order and/or the construction order by answering pre-defined questions.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">During the quoting process, the item-assigned checklist is copied to the sales line (Document Checklists). After completing the Document Checklist, the Master BOM can be interpreted and copied to the sales line (Document BOM). Both checklists and Document BOMs can be changed on the orders. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Afterwards, a construction order is generated from a sales order. The construction order is a copy of the BOM for the order (Document BOM). The construction order can be changed and modified by the engineering department. After technical review of the construction order, a production order is generated (this can come also from the sales order).</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">A PDM (product data management) system can be connected bi-directionally by an interface. <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|configure to order</span> integrates with the ProfiDB system, from the company Keytech (<a href="http://www.keytech.de/">www.keytech.de</a>).</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">During MRP – using the planning worksheets or the order planning functionality – requisitions for the order can be created. This happens either at the time of manufacturing, construction or from the sales order. Items with long lead times are planned by the “Order Promising” function on the BOM level as required in the order. </p>

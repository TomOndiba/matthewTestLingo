        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The <span class="Bold">Demand Date</span> and <span class="Bold">Planned Date</span> fields in the <span class="Bold">Order Network</span> page are transferred from the corresponding document. If there is a deviation between those dates, (Planning Date &gt; Demand Date) the <span class="Bold">Warning</span> check box is selected. The <span class="Bold">Warning</span> check box is also selected if there is an issue with item availability.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The <span class="Bold">Include Warning</span> check box indicates that there is a warning, but the line itself is not causing the warning. Expand the lines within the line that has the check box selected to see the lines that are causing the warning. </p>

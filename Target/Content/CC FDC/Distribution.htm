        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Distribution is a function specific to Order Bundles. Therefore a Bundle Line (also called “0-Line”) is distributed to all underlying Order Bundle Lines, according to the settings of the <span class="Bold">Order Bundle Time Distribution</span> and <span class="Bold">Order Bundle Qty. Distribution</span> fields on the <span class="Bold">Order Bundle</span> FastTab in the FDC Work Order. Times and quantities can be distributed as determined by the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Uniform – distribution posts the same part of times/quantities to all lines. </li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Expected Time/Expected Qty. – distributes according to the Expected Time/Qty. of each line. </li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Actual Qty./Actual Time – distributes the quantity first and then the time, and vice versa for “Actual Time” (the time gets distributed first and then the quantity). According to this, a setting of “Actual Time” and “Actual Qty.” is invalid. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">In FDC Setup, the <span class="Bold">Automatic Order Bundle Distribution When Posting</span> field can be set to instantly apply a new distribution after each posting on an FDC Work Order. Alternatively, a new distribution can be applied by clicking <span class="Bold">Distribute</span> on the ribbon of the <span class="Bold">FDC Work Order</span> page. With this function, a later change of the distribution key and a new distribution can be made.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When distributing, a new FDC (Distribution) Entry per Order Bundle Line is created for each FDC Entry of a Bundle Line. This Distribution Entry contains the calculated part of the “0-Line” by using the key as an FDC Detailed Entry. On further distributions, the Detailed Entries get cancelled and new entries will be created. The Distribution Entry remains.</p>

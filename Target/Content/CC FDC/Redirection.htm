        <p class="ccBildFigure" MadCap:autonum="Fig. 1">: Redirecting to other Work Order Operations</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">A Redirect allows users to capture data on one Work Order Operation without posting to the operation by transferring the data to other operations.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">For example, operations for Work Orders WO-0010 and WO-0012 are contained in Order Bundle WO-0015. Data is captured in Order Bundle WO-0015 but the postings need to be processed in Work Orders WO-0010 and WO-0012. By setting the <span class="Bold">Redirect to FDC Work Order No.</span> and <span class="Bold">Redirect to FDC Work Order Line No.</span> fields on WO-0015 to the corresponding operations on Work Orders WO-0010 and WO-0012, the Redirect function transfers all the captured from Order Bundle WO-0015 to Work Orders WO-0010 and WO-0012 for posting.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">During posting, all information like permissions or dimensions from the original capture line are checked.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">FDC Work Orders can be created with or without a source. A standard Microsoft Dynamics NAV source may be applied for the modules “Production Order”, “Job”, “Service Order” or “Assembly Order”. If the <span class="Bold">Create FDC WO Automatically</span> check box is selected in FDC Setup, FDC Work Orders can be created automatically when creating a source order. So combined with the setting of the <span class="Bold">Create Missing FDC Resources</span> check box, the redirection of standard Microsoft Dynamics NAV orders to <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|factory data capture</span> can be applied automatically. If a customized integration of creating FDC Work Orders is desired, e.g. throughout actions in source documents, FDC offers an interface codeunit (refer to topic <MadCap:xref href="Interface Codeunit for Creating.htm#_Ref427921889" class="RelLinkPageNumber">"Interface Codeunit for Creating FDC Work Orders" on page 1</MadCap:xref>) with corresponding functionalities. The corresponding source documents/lines can be accessed from the <span class="Bold">FDC Work Order Lines</span> FastTab by clicking <span class="Bold">Line &gt; Source Document</span> and <span class="Bold">Line &gt; Source Document Line</span>.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">An FDC Work Order can create a reference to a production order via the From Production Order function on the ribbon. Therefore the routing lines of all production order lines are created as FDC Work Order Lines and the expected times and quantities are transferred. If an FDC Resource is found for the work center or work center group, it is selected as well. Using the FDC Interface Codeunit, it is possible to create an FDC Work Order for a production order line.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The “From Job” function creates routing lines for every job planning line of <span class="Bold">Type</span> = <span class="Italics">Resource</span>. During this process, the expected times and found FDC resources are transferred to the FDC Work Order. If the source is a service order, an FDC Work Order Line is created for all service lines with <span class="Bold">Type</span> = <span class="Italics">Resource</span> along with the expected times. Using the “From Assembly Order” function will create an FDC Work Order Line for each assembly line.</p>

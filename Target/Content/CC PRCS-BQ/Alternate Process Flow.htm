        <p>Instead of importing the file directly into a job, it is possible to import the GAEB file into the GAEB List. This is useful when it is too early in the process to create a job but it necessary to review the information in the file. The file could be altered and exported back from the GAEB Card/List. Later, if a job is created for this file, it can be imported from the GAEB List instead of re-importing into the job; therefore, a new GAEB record is not created for the same GAEB file.</p>

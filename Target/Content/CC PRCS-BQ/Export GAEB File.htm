        <p>Once the quote request (phase 83) has been reviewed and updated, it can be sent back to the customer by creating a export file in the next phase (84, Quote Bid). Typically, the update of the information in the GAEB file is done in the Fast Calculation or BoQ Budget Calculation so calculations can be performed. These updates are transferred back to the GAEB Card so the export essentially can be done from either the GAEB List/Card or Job List/Card by clicking <span class="Bold">Export GAEB</span> on the ribbon.</p>
        <p>The basic process of the export is that the file is saved to a storage location. Depending on where the export originates, the process can vary. From the GAEB List/Card, the file is simply exported. From the Job List/Card, additional steps are required (refer to section <MadCap:xref href="Export as Phase 84.htm">“Export as Phase 84” on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information).</p>
        <p>After export, it is possible to view the exported file using a tool like Notepad. </p>

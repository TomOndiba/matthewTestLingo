        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Construction Works Processing is an add-on to <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|project</span> which provides process support to Construction Works Industries through the management of Construction Projects from the sales process to the invoicing process.</p>
        <p>The BoQ Manager provides the ability to transfer GAEB files electronically between companies for the purpose of bidding on and awarding construction projects based on a standard process. GAEB – or Gemeinsamer Ausschuss fuer Elektronik im Bauwesen, which can be translated as “Joint Committee on Electronics in Construction” – is a German organization that defines the standards in electronic data exchange for construction works industries (refer to <a href="http://www.gaeb.de/en/">http://www.gaeb.de/en/</a> for more information). </p>
        <p>In <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|project</span>, Construction Works Processing supports the import/export of the GAEB 90, GAEB 2000 and GAEB XML files to/from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. The GAEB files are the basis of the Calculation specifications.</p>
        <p>Construction Works Processing uses the GAEB Konverter from T&amp;T Datentechnik GmbH to convert the above formats into a special XML format (TML) that can be processed by Microsoft Dynamics NAV.</p>

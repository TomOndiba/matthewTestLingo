        <p>Measurements are needed if the invoice must be based on measurements. If invoices are created without measurements this process is not applicable.</p>
        <p>Usually the technician records all measurements (quantities) at the construction area to document all provided activities. Later the customer will sign a measurement document (not currently available in <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|project</span>) and often something will be cancelled in this document, e.g. 100 meters of cable is changed to 90 meters. If the changes from the customer are accepted, the vendor must update their measurement quantities. For that, negative quantities can be entered in the <span class="Bold">Measurement</span> page as well. If the changes are not accepted, that position will be invoiced later at the original quantity, e.g. 100 meters.</p>

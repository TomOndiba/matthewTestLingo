        <p class="ccBildFigure" MadCap:autonum="Fig. 1">: Project and BoQ Job for calculation processing</p>
        <p>The GAEB file must be imported into the BoQ Job so calculations can be performed for the quote. As previously mentioned, the file can be imported directly into a job using the “Import GAEB” function or a previously imported file can be added to a job using the “Get GAEB File” function.</p>

        <p>This section explains the various types of calculations that are performed in the BoQ Jobs after a GAEB file is imported. It includes the basic steps of reviewing the BoQ Position List, adding generic wage and material information for the quote using the Fast Calculation, adding more detailed quote information using the BoQ Budget Calculation, exporting the quote as Phase 84, running the EFB calculation, reviewing the submission ranking, and using the compare tool when the project is awarded. </p>

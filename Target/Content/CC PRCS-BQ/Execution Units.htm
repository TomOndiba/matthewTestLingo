        <p>Execution Units will be created based on a BoQ (specification). Execution Units are used for two different processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Placing unit – used for subcontracting purposes. This type of Execution Unit integrates into the Purchase Quotes Manager (PQM) for subcontracting quotes. Later, this Execution Unit is used for processing the purchase. Therefore, the placing unit is added to the work breakdown structure of a PaC Job.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Work package – used for the processing of a construction job. This type of Execution Unit has the ability to create the work breakdown structure of PaC Jobs structured by Work packages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Execution Units are also a type of controlling instrument for the construction processing.</p>
        <p>This topic describes how to use both types of Execution Units for Construction Works Processing.</p>

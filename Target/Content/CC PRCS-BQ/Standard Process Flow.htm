        <p>The standard process flow of working with GAEB files in <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|project</span> is that a customer sends a GAEB file to many vendors for bidding. As the vendor using <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|project</span>, a Project is created for the bid, and then a BoQ Job is created, to which the GAEB file is imported. After review and/or changes are made in the GAEB Card, the GAEB file is exported back to the customer. This process can occur several times during negotiations. Once a bid has been awarded, GAEB files from vendor and customer  can be compared to ensure that the expectations are the same.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">PaC stands for Processing and Controlling. The processing job line structure could be completely different than the Bill of Quantities structure, which is why there is an additional job for planning and processing the job.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The PaC Job uses the default project functionalities  for process planning, procurement planning and shipment planning. The supplemental <span class="Bold">Structural Plan</span> page includes two new functions to get calculated components from the BoQ Job into the lines of the PaC Job.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Typically, the PaC Job is created after the sales order is created in the BoQ Job.</p>

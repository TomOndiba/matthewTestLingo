        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When creating a document, the drawing set of the previous document or the valid drawings of the item are always inherited. Changing the drawing set in a document will pass it on to the next document. It is only important that the drawing set has a status that allows it to be passed on to the new document.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">
            <MadCap:xref href="#InheritingDrawings" class="Figure">Fig. 1</MadCap:xref> illustrates the inheritance process.</p>

        <p><span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|product data management</span> is an industry solution of COSMO CONSULT certified by Microsoft Business Solutions.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The module <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|product data management</span> offers a wide range of product data management features within Microsoft Dynamics NAV.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The technical documents in the fields of mechanics, electrical engineering and electronics are managed together according to the same rules. The creation of drawing revisions is largely automatic. This also applies to the provision of drawings and documents for production, purchasing and service.</p>
        <p class="BoldItalics12pt">Key Features</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Drawing Management</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Revision Management</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Change Management</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Integration to more than 20 Computer-Aided Design (CAD) / Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) / Product Data Management (PDM) systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage"><span class="BoldUnderline">Drawing Management</span> can be used to manage any drawings and drawing revisions. Drawings are assigned to items and BOMs according to a flexible logic and thus create transparency regarding the use of this data. Using status management, the technician can insert and control drawings and documents specifically in the process.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The <span class="BoldUnderline">Revision Management</span> ensures the consistency of drawing changes throughout Microsoft Dynamics NAV. A usage check provides information about where a particular drawing is used. Based on this information, you can decide, for example, whether an entire product structure needs to be revised, or only an individual part or an individual assembly. It is therefore not a direct module that has an impact, but rather a form of control mechanism. This takes effect during change management.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Cross-divisional processes are controlled using the <span class="BoldUnderline">Change Management</span>. Change requests are transferred directly to the design. Detailed information about the type of change and the affected components is available. Based on this information, the designer can check the process and decide on a product change. Product changes are controlled by change requests in the business organization. A flexible task plan defines specific tasks for all relevant departments. The designer therefore always has an overview of the current processing status of the changes.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage"><span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|product data management – cad connector</span> is an extension of  <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|product data management</span> and enables the seamless integration of various CAD, PDM and PLM systems in Microsoft Dynamics NAV.</p>
        <p>A flexible setup ensures that the data in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is always up-to-date. In addition to the creation of drawings, items and BOMs, the processes are also harmonized by CAD and ERP systems. The transfer of the status of a drawing directly controls processes in the ERP system. If required, the ERP user can add components to the generated BOMs without deleting them when changing drawings.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Standard Texts offers the ability to create a text pool with a variety of different texts. The advantage is that texts of the text pool can be copied into master data and documents as headers, footers, or line texts instead of creating them manually each time. Manual modifications of the copied texts are possible (the original text of the text pool is not affected by these modifications).</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Standard Text can be created generally or specific to sales and purchases. </p>

        <p>Generally, the interface works in several steps (or layers) as described in topic <MadCap:xref href="Interface Layers.htm" class="RelLinkPageNumber">"Interface Layers" on page 1</MadCap:xref>. The following steps are necessary for implementing an interface.</p>
        <p class="BoldItalics12pt">Step 1: External System Sending or Requesting Data</p>
        <p>This can be an external device like a terminal or a 3rd party application for machine data collection. This device or application can actively trigger an action or transaction in the interface or passively where e.g. the job queue checks for file.</p>
        <p class="BoldItalics12pt"> Step 2: Transporting the Data or Request</p>
        <p>The interface can use different ways of transporting data. These ways must be implemented per interface as long as they cannot be abstracted to a common transportation channel. Currently there is one pre-implemented transportation layer: the data transport via a text file. But there are several other ways possible like publishing a codeunit as an SOAP web service.</p>
        <p class="BoldItalics12pt">Step 3: Converting Data</p>
        <p>Define which format the data has that is received or sent. Inbound data must be interpreted and written into the normalized data structure, and outbound must be read from the internal data structure and written to the expected structure. For reading and writing to the internal data structure, the interface provides a set of functions.</p>
        <p class="BoldItalics12pt">Steps 4: Processing Data</p>
        <p>After data has been transported and converted, it has to be processed. In this step the data is written to the interface data structure, and must be transferred to Microsoft Dynamics NAV or the product table and be processed. Such a transferring of data from the interface and processing could e.g. be the filling of a journal and posting the journal. But scenarios where no data is processed by Microsoft Dynamics NAV can be possible e.g. requesting Production Orders or Items. </p>

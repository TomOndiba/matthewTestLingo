        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="1   ">cc|purchase quotes manager</h1>
        <p><span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|purchase quotes manager</span> (PQM) is an add-on to <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|project</span>. This functionality is used to manage multiple quote requests with varying prices, from multiple vendors, for one or more job lines. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Once the vendor is chosen, PQM provides the ability to move relevant quote information (vendor number, direct unit cost, quote date, etc.) to the job line(s). However, since the PQM is independent from the procurement process, there are two scenarios for handling the information once the PQM process is complete:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">The quotes can be deleted because only the prices were needed; the job line can move normally through the procurement process.</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">The placed quote(s) are used later for procurement but are not used in the procurement planning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNoteheading">Note</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNotebody">PQM can also be used for Requisitions Worksheet lines  as well as directly from the <span class="Bold">PQM</span> page.</p>

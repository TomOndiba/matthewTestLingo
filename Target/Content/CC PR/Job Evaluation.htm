        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Work in Progress (WIP) is the project value that has not been completed but has already incurred a capital investment from the project. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">In principle, a value is only redeemable for a released sales document. This value can vary in some cases because its total amount is not known at the point of sale (for example, if charging on a Time &amp; Material basis, the sales value is only an estimate). </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The observed value can vary at any time of the project, the ascertaining of the value depends on the applicable legal framework. Usually an evaluation is based on cost, but a valuation could also include additional profit shares valued over the cost mark.Â  </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The valuation enables the profit and loss statement to be prepared in a timely manner for the period and the expenses can be linked to the right accounting period. </p>

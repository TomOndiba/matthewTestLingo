        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The first Sales Preview row shows the production order for the sales order as of the Shipment Date and links to the second Sales Preview row which ends on the Requested Delivery Date (Due Date). No changes to the sales order/production order can be made in this view; it is only a method of viewing other production orders that could be preventing a specific delivery date.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The temporary planned production order is deleted when the <span class="Bold">Sales Order Manuf. Preview</span> page is closed.</p>

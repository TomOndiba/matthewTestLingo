        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|quality management</span> module enables users to manually or automatically create test orders within the complete supply chain (from the purchase order via manufacturing to the point of the shipment or the sales return order). <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|quality management</span> provides users with the system-related preconditions to guarantee the required quality of raw materials and products and to document this quality assurance within the ERP system and therefore within the process chain.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">In the Test Device Management functionality, Test Orders can be prepared for all Test Devices used for testing the Test Properties. The Test Devices, Test Properties and Test Property Sets that are defined in the related master data are combined into Test Plans which serve as a template for Test Orders.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Furthermore, this module contains the logic of DIN ISO 2859, which is the acceptance random sample testing based on the number of faulty units or errors.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">It is also possible to create test orders manually without any reference to purchase or manufacturing, for example, if an inspection of stored goods should be performed.</p>

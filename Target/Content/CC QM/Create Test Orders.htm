        <p>When a document type with Sample Planning is processed for an item, the system creates multiple Test Orders based on the Test Plan Setup AND the Sample Planning. </p>
        <p>For example, Sample Occurrence SO000001 was assigned to item Q-40012 which required test orders upon purchase receipt. Therefore, when a purchase receipt is posted one test order is created per 50 units on the purchase line, plus one additional test order. </p>
        <p>In this example, a purchase order is created for 303 units of item Q-40012, and is equally assigned to three different lots (LOT_A001, LOT_A002 and LOT_A003).</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">A total of nine Test Orders appear: three for each Lot No. because the Test Plan Setup requires a Test Order for each Lot No. The Sample Planning of one per 50 Units and one Test Order extra for each Test that is necessary is based on the Test Plan Setup.</p>

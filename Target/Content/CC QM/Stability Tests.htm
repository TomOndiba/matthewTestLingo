        <p class="ccTextvorlage">With Stability Tests it is possible to determine how a lot will behave under various inventory conditions like temperature, brightness, or humidity during a certain period. In this case, it is possible to create a stability test, which is the basis for testing lots in calculated intervals. The tests are carried out based on defined test plans. All collected test results of the particular features can be printed.</p>

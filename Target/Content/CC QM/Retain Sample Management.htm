        <p>The Retain Sample Management functionality makes shares of a lot part of a reusable item structure. The state of the item on production/shipment is fixed by taking a certain part of it and storing it for a certain period of time. The quantity and time period are set up in the Retain Sample Instructions.</p>
        <p>Once setup is complete, the system uses the status from the <span class="Bold">Quality Management Setup</span> page to take the entered quantity and move it as a retained sample to the new location on Sales Order Shipment and/or Production Output. </p>

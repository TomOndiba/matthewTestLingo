            <p class="ccTextvorlage">Comments, Tools, Personnel and Quality Measures can be added to Work Center Production Rates and then copied to the related production order routing line if a work center production rate is used for a production order line, for example by production order calculation or work center change in Sequence Planning. These settings can be manually entered on the <span class="Bold">Navigate</span> tab of the <span class="Bold">Work Center Prod. Rate Card</span> page.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlageNotebody">The <span class="Bold">Standard Tasks</span> page is the same as the Work Center Production Rates Card except comments are entered using the <span class="Bold">Description</span> action. The description text transfers to the Comment Sheet on the routing line.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Once the settings have been assigned to the production rate, each is automatically transferred to the production order routing line. These settings are overwritten if the work center is changed to one that has different settings or removed if changed to one that has no settings. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If a routing line has been changed from a work center with no production rate to one with production rates, and then changed back to the originating work center, the routing information (setup and run time, comments, tools, personnel and quality measures) are also reverted to the original value in Sequence Planning.</p>

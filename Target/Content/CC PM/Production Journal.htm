        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The production journal is standard manufacturing functionality in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. In <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|process manufacturing</span>, two functions have been added:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Gathering of the Posting Quantity – Initially, the current remaining quantity from the production order is used as the posting quantity. If the posting quantity is changed, the output lines are updated with the posting quantity. The quantities and times of components with flushing method “Manual” are recalculated proportionally based on the posting quantity. The quantities of components with other flushing methods will remain “0”.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Gathering of the Scrap % – During the change of the <span class="Bold">Scrap %</span> field, all raw materials and times are recalculated in this journal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The calculated values can be changed at any time.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">For more information about the standard functionality, refer to the Production Order Processing content in the current Microsoft Dynamics NAV Manufacturing training material.</p>

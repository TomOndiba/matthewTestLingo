        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When an item is entered on a purchase order, the purchase delivery tolerance code from the item card is transferred in the order line and may be modified there. During the entry of the <span class="Bold">Qty. to Receive</span> field, the delivery tolerance is checked. The following actions are possible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Quantity is increased and is over the tolerance = Error message</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Quantity is increased and is within the tolerance = Quantity is increased (if message accepted)</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Quantity is reduced and is within the tolerance = Quantity is reduced (if message accepted)</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Quantity is reduced and is over the tolerance = No changes</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When changing the quantity within the tolerance, a delivery tolerance entry is created.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If the <span class="Bold">Qty. to Receive</span> field is increased or changed back to the original value, the value in the <span class="Bold">Quantity</span> field is also changed and the delivery tolerance entries are deleted. The posting of a delivery tolerance is stored in the <span class="Bold">Delivery Tolerance Entries</span> page. After posting, the delivery tolerance entry cannot be modified.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If a warehouse receipt is created for an order, the check of over and under delivery is done by the <span class="Bold">Qty. to Receive</span> field on the warehouse receipt line. If a delivery is canceled, the delivery tolerance entries are reopened.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The setting of contingents means to set a limit of the shipment quantity for a certain period. It can be specified that a contingent group (customers or contacts) are not to receive more than a certain quantity of an item (or a contingent item group) over the defined period of time. Additionally, the exemption from charges can also be regulated. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">For example, each contact from a specific contingent group is not to receive more than 10 kg of an item from a specific contingent item group free of charge over a period of 12 months. Once the 12 months have elapsed, another 10 kg of the item can be shipped without charge. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Legal regulations or other agreements are often the reason for such restrictions on shipment. Therefore, a reference to the particular shipment restriction is, in most cases, included in the documents.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">This functionality can also be used for restricting the free shipment of samples (Medical Samples, art. 47 para. 4 AMG – German Medicines Act). Pharmaceutical manufacturers are not allowed to deliver more than two small products packages per year to a German doctor for free. As soon as the contingent has been exhausted, <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|process manufacturing</span> displays a message and prevents any further postings. </p>

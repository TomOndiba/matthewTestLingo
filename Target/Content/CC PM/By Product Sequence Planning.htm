        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If an item’s routing contains a work center that is a sequence work center and a production order is created for this item, the production order line is shown in the <span class="Bold">Sequence Planning</span> page for that work center.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If the item has by-products, the production order contains an additional production order line for each by-product. These lines are attached to the production order line for the main item (the line shown in sequence planning).</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The additional lines are not shown in the <span class="Bold">Sequence Planning</span> page for the work center. But if a user changes the starting or ending times of the production order line of the main item manually – by re-scheduling or by moving the line to a different sequence position – the starting and ending times of the additional production order lines are changed as well.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Refer to topic <MadCap:xref href="Sequence Planning.htm#_Ref379128670">“Sequence Planning” on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When pricing is based on quantities sold/purchased, it can be affected by the change due to delivery tolerances. This situation is managed by the <span class="Bold">Calculate New Price</span> field in the <span class="Bold">Delivery Tolerances</span> page. If the field is set to <span class="Italics">Always</span>, <span class="Italics">On Overdelivery</span> or <span class="Italics">On Underdelivery</span>, the price of the document line must be recalculated in consideration of the new quantity on entering of an over-/under-delivery. If the field is set to <span class="Italics">No</span>, the unit price/cost remains unchanged.</p>

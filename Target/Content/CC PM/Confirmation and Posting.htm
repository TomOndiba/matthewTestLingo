        <p class="ccTextvorlage">After maintenance is done by the engineers, the maintenance order can be updated with the damage reasons and types, and the Ending Date should be set.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Orders that are processed internally can contain item and resource lines. Orders that are processed by external companies can contain G/L accounts. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Prior to posting the order, the <span class="Bold">Status</span> must be changed to <span class="Italics">Finished</span>. The maintenance order can be posted by clicking <span class="Bold">Post</span> on the ribbon. The entire maintenance order will be archived and then the <span class="Bold">Maintenance Order Archive</span> page can be opened from the Plant Maintenance menu.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The <span class="Bold">Posted-by Entry No.</span> field on the <span class="Bold">Lines</span> FastTab refers to the last entry that was posted because of the maintenance order line. Depending on the type, it can be an Item Ledger Entry, a Resource Ledger Entry, or a G/L Entry. No maintenance entries are posted for fixed assets because the Plant Maintenance is not linked to the Fixed Asset module.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The confirmation of the production order with the times for the failure of the machine is posted separately by the production planner. The times can differ from the posted times for the maintenance order and the entries must be attached to the work center as well. </p>

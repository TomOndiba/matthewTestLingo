        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Calculations are created for each new production order line if a production order is split. These calculations are then added to an existing concurrent calculation. The effect is that more than one production order is shown in concurrent calculation.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If multiple production order lines are combined, an existing concurrent calculation cannot be updated. In addition, new concurrent calculations are not created and an error message is generated.</p>

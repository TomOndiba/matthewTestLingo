            <p class="ccTextvorlage">A tool is planned parallel to the machine in the sequence planning. During this, a dummy routing line is created before and after the routing lines of the machine and tool (if no other routing lines are available). The same setup and run times are calculated in the production order for the machine and the corresponding tool.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When a new tool is created, the system verifies whether a tool already exists. If more than one tool is created, only one is designated as the main tool. Only the main tools are displayed in the <span class="Bold">Sequence Planning</span> page.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When a production order is created, the tools are scheduled at the same time as the machine. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Tools can be changed on the Sequence Planning lines by selecting the line to change on the <span class="Bold">Lines</span> FastTab and then clicking <span class="Bold">Functions &gt; Change Tool</span>. Select the new tool from the list that appears, click <span class="Bold">OK</span> and then click <span class="Bold">Yes</span> to assign the new tool. The sequence planning and the production order routing lines are updated with the new tool. Refer to topic <MadCap:xref href="Sequence Planning_Lines FastTab 2.htm#_Ref368562008">“Change Tool” on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>

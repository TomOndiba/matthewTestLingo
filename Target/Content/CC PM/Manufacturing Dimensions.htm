        <p class="ccTextvorlage">A manufacturing dimension is data that can be added to an item, item variant, sequence work center, or a production order line as a kind of marker so that the program can group and sort records with similar characteristics.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Each dimension can have an unlimited series of manufacturing dimension values that are sub-units of that manufacturing dimension. For example, a manufacturing dimension called Color can have colors called “Red”, “Blue” and so on as sub-units. These colors are manufacturing dimension values. Manufacturing dimensions and manufacturing dimension values are user-defined and unlimited, which means users can create manufacturing dimensions tailored to their company's needs and business processes.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Manufacturing dimension can be used to sort production order lines by user-defined information and priorities in the sequence planning. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Additionally, planning dimensions can be specified for sequence planning. There is a difference between planning and manufacturing dimensions: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Planning dimensions of a work center are the dimensions used for the priority planning of a work center. Here users can specify that they want to sort the orders for the work center in sequence planning by due date, then by color and so on.</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Manufacturing dimensions are attributes of the work center. Users can enter a type, a location or anything else for a work center just as they would enter manufacturing dimensions for an item. This information is copied to a production order line that uses this work center. The manufacturing dimensions of the item are copied to the production order lines as well. </li>
        </ul>

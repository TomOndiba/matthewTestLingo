            <p class="ccTextvorlage">An item may have more than one production structure. Due to changes in the materials, work centers and times, different unit costs are calculated.</p>
            <p class="ccTextvorlage">In general, the standard production structure is transferred to the item and is also the base for the calculation.</p>
            <p class="ccTextvorlage">A calculation can be opened from a production variant and then the calculated standard cost can be compared with the calculated unit cost from the variant.</p>
            <p class="ccTextvorlage">In this example, a detail calculation is opened from a production variant that was created from a production structure.</p>

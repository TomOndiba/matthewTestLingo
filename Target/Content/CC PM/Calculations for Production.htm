        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.1.1    ">Calculations for Production Structures</h3>
        <p>Calculations can be made for any type of Production Structure. The process of creating the calculation is the same for each; the difference lies in the required information due to item definitions during product development.</p>
        <p>When creating a Development Structure, often the output item and some components have not been defined (in the idea of conceptual item without an Item Card). Therefore, special RnD fields in the header and lines must be populated to provide the necessary conversion of weights, unit of measure and costing information for calculating recipes.</p>
        <p>For Laboratory Structures, all components must be defined with actual items, but the output item may not be defined yet. Therefore, the special RnD fields in the header must be populated to provide the necessary conversion of net and recipe weights  for calculating recipes.</p>
        <p>Items are completely defined in a Manufacturing Structure before it can be certified and, thus, a Calculation created. Therefore, no special fields are necessary for calculating recipes; the weights and costs from the Item Cards of the product (output) are used.</p>
        <p>Another difference to the previously described Production Structures, is that the values in the special RnD fields, as well as the actual Calculations, are not transferred from Development Structure to Laboratory Structure, and Laboratory Structure to Manufacturing Structure. Each Calculation is specific to each particular Production Structure. </p>
        <p>This topic first describes the basic Calculation creation process on a Manufacturing Structure, since additional information is not required to create the Calculation. Then the special fields in the Development and Laboratory Structures are described.</p>

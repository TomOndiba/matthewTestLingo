        </h1>
        <p>With hour-based invoicing, it is possible to calculate prices based on portions of days by entering a date and time on Shipment, Return and Rental Change. The calculation considers a basic working time frame from the Rental Mgt. Setup.</p>
        <p>To enable a small hour based invoicing, the Starting Time (Rental Shipment Time) and Ending Time (Rental Return Time) of the Rent Item must be added to the Rent Order and attached Service Contracts. On invoicing the Shipment Date and/or Receipt date, the amount for the Shipment/Receipt Date will be reduced by the part of the working day that is not Invoiced.</p>
        <p>An invoice cannot be created until the rental return is processed. </p>

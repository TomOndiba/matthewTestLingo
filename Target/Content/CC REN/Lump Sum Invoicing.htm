        <p>With lump-sum invoicing, the periodic invoicing is skipped and the amount agreed upon will be invoiced on start or at end of the rental as determined by the Prepaid setting on the line.</p>
        <p>To determine a lower (lump sum) price for the rental duration, a manual calculation can be used in the Rental Rate Price structure, in which the No. of Rate Units is calculated on creation of the Rent Order and can be changed manually.</p>

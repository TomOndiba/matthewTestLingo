        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="1   ">Graduated Rental Pricing</h1>
        <p>Graduated Rental Pricing is a price structure based on the total rental time as well as a price that is valid from a specific date. There are two methods of using this type of pricing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Non-cascaded scale price – a minimum number of rental units is assigned to the Rental Price. Once this number is met, based on the Rental Start Date and Rental End Date on the Rent Order line, the special pricing is used for each invoice period. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccAufzahlungblaunobullet">For example, standard price is 300 per month for one – six months. If the rental is more than six months, the price is 275. Therefore, when the rental period is entered on the Rent Order line, the price will be 275 if the period exceeds six months.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">Cascaded scale price – multiple rates can be assigned to the Rental Price based on various time periods. Using the minimum number of rental units along with a setting for cascading pricing, once a number is met based on the invoice period, the next pricing is used for the invoice period until the next number is met, and so on. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ccAufzahlungblaunobullet">For example, standard price is 300 per month for the first four months, 275 for the next four months and then 250 for the next four months. Regardless of the rental start/end dates, the price on the Rent Order line is 300. When invoicing, months 1–4 will be 300, months 5–8 will be 275 and months 9–12 will be 250, regardless of the invoice date range. Therefore, an invoice that includes the first six months will have four months at 300 and two months at 275; the invoice for the next six months will have two months at 275 and four months at 250.</p>
        <p class="ccAufzahlungblaunobullet">If a price change needs to occur during an invoicing period, the amounts will be calculated based on the Rental Prices.</p>
        <p>The graduated pricing is first set universally for item/customer combination in the <span class="Bold">Rental Prices</span> page but can be modified per Rent Order in the <span class="Bold">Rental Cascaded Price</span> page.</p>

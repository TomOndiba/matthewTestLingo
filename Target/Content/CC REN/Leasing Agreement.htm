        <p class="ccTextvorlage">When a customer leases an item, it is actually borrowing the item from the leasing company and paying for the depreciation that occurs during the term of the lease. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The payments are based on the difference between the price of the car (its “capitalized cost”) and what it is worth at the end of the lease (its “residual value”).</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">If at the end of the lease the customer wants to purchase the item, the customer can exercise the purchase option as defined in the leasing agreement. Otherwise, the item will be returned by the customer at lease-end.   </p>

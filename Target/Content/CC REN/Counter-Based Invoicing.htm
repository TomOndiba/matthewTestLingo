        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="1   ">Counter-Based Invoicing</h1>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Counter-based invoicing provides the ability to calculate the hours or miles (tracked by a counter) in which a rental item is used and add any overages to the rental invoice. Hours or miles that are included in the standard rental price are defined in the Rental Prices. Counter values – which are stored in the Machine Card – are updated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">required prior to shipment</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">as needed during the rental process on the Machine Card or Service Order</li>
            <li class="ccAufzählungblau">required prior to return</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The shipment counter can use the current value from the Machine Card or a manual update can be done in the Stock Movement for shipments. The return counter must be updated in the Stock Movement for returns.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">For invoicing, the hours or miles are calculated based on a per hour/mile rate. The difference between the return counter value, the free hours/miles included in the rental price, and the shipment counter value is added as a new line to the rental invoice.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Additionally, the <span class="Bold">Min. Invoice Free Operation Capacity</span> setting in the Rental Prices can be used with counters to prevent the crediting of amounts, i.e., no negative lines are added to the invoice when the used hours/miles are less than the amount included in the rental price.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">For more information about Machine Counters and Stock Movements, refer to topics <MadCap:xref href="Operation Counters.htm">“Operation Counters” on page 1</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Stock Movements.htm">“Stock Movements” on page 1</MadCap:xref>.</p>

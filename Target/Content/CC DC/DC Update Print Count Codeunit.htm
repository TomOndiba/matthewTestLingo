        <p class="ccTextvorlage">This Codeunit runs the print count functionality for documents printed from the following tables: Sales Header, Purchase Header, Sales Shipment Header, Sales Invoice Header, Sales Cr. Memo Header, Warehouse Activity Header, Issued Reminder Header and Issued Finance Statement Header. It has been programmed so that it does not count during preview or when printing copies. The way this codeunit is used is to set up the Section (Document Layout Line) to run it once per record to update the print counter at the time of printing.</p>

        <p class="ccTextvorlage">This Codeunit logs an interaction for documents printed from the following tables: Sales Header, Purchase Header, Sales Shipment Header, Sales Invoice Header, Sales Cr. Memo Header, Issued Reminder Header and Issued Finance Statement Header.  It has been programmed  so that no logging is carried out when previewing or printing copies. The way this codeunit is used is to set up the Section (Document Layout Line)  to execute this code once per record, which then performs logging during printing.</p>

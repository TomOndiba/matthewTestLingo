        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The posting of prepayment invoices in sales documents is not considered in commission statements because there is no item movement caused by a prepayment invoice. Sales documents with posted prepayments are considered in the commission statement by posting the shipment, invoice or payment receipt.</p>

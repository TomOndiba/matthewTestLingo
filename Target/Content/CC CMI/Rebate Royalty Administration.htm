        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The <span class="CCBausteinInhaltZchn">cc|commission</span> module can be used the same way for the rebate/royalty calculation. The setup and basic settings is very similar to the commission setup. </p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNoteheading">Note</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNotebody">All pages are still referred to as “Commission” instead of “Rebate/Royalty”.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">Regarding the calculation, there is no difference between rebate and commission administration. The main difference in terms of the setup resides in the fact that the customer – who should receive a rebate/royalty – has to be maintained as a rebate/royalty recipient on the Commission Recipient Card. In the current version, there is no link to the finance module or an automatic posting of the rebate/royalty to the customer’s account.</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlage">The main steps of the rebate/royalty setup are as follows:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li class="ccTextvorlageNumberedList">Define the rebate/royalty calculation basis in the <span class="Bold">Commission Setup</span> page. Here it can be decided to which basis the rebate/royalty is referring to, in other words, if discounts are taken into consideration for the rebate/royalty calculation basis.</li>
            <li class="ccTextvorlageNumberedList">Creation of the rebate/royalty recipient on the Commission Recipient Card. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNumberedListNoteHeadingIndent">Note</p>
        <p class="ccTextvorlageNumberedListNoteBodyIndent"> A rebate/royalty cannot be assigned directly to a customer.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li class="ccTextvorlageNumberedList">Link rebate/royalty recipient and customer on the Customer/Commission Recipient Catalog.</li>
            <li class="ccTextvorlageNumberedList">Creation of the rebate/royalty rates on the Commission Rates. Rebate/Royalty Rates can be defined – as above explained – the same as the commission rates based on quantity or amount scales. The validity can be limited for all customers, customer groups, or individual customers in combination with all items, item groups or specific items (refer to topic <MadCap:xref href="Commission Setup.htm#_Ref414545111">“Example – Commission Search Order” on page 1</MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ol>
